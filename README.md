# Android Basics Nanodegree by Google (My 10 Projects)

Topics covered in the Nanodegree program:

* **User Interface** - You will learn how to build nice screens, layouts according to standards, so your apps will look good
User Input - You will learn how to make your apps interactive.
* **MultiScreen Apps** - The more screen you have, the more possibilities you discover. You will learn about switching among different screens, activities and fragments.
* **Networking** - There are a huge amount of available API-s all over the internet, with the help of them you can build apps with dynamic content. You will learn about HTTP requests, JSON Parsing and threads.
* **Data Storage** - Now you have the data, you need to store them somewhere, right? You'll learn about storing data with the help of SQLite.

You will learn all of the above through 10 relevant projects step by step. These are te 10 projects I completed during the 6 month Android Basics Nanodegree by Google Scholarship:
